# Contributing to AntOS Kernel Rewrite

First off, thank you for considering contributing to AntOS Kernel Rewrite. You'll be one of the First to contribute!
I'll recommend you add [me](https://github.com/joschatom) on Discord, see my profile for more information. I'll be able to answer questions there, if possible.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/rust-kernel.git`

4. Make your changes.
5. Push your branch and changes to your GitHub repository: `git push origin name-of-your-branch`

## Code Contributions

Here are a few important things you should know about contributing code:

1. Big changes require discussion, if you'd like to do that, please open an issue.
2. Make sure all tests are passing before submitting a pull request (currently the build task doesn't work, so it doesn't count).
3. Include relevant documentation with your code changes.

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include as much detail as possible. The more we know, the better we can help. Try to include:

- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
